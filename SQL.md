## Repository: **Plateau State Healthcare Access Analysis**

### Project Overview

This repository contains SQL queries designed to analyze healthcare access data in Plateau State. The purpose of this project is to better understand the distribution of diseases, demographic information, and healthcare access patterns in the region. By analyzing healthcare data, we aim to identify trends that can inform healthcare policy, resource allocation, and public health interventions for the state.

### Key Areas of Focus

1. **Healthcare Access and Outcomes**:
   The project uses a dataset `healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau`, which includes information about various diseases, patient demographics, and the geographic regions (LGAs) of Plateau State. The queries are designed to extract meaningful insights related to disease distribution, demographics, and overall healthcare access.

2. **SQL Analysis**:
   The analysis leverages SQL queries to explore different facets of healthcare access and disease outcomes. These queries will help answer questions such as:
   - Which gender has the most reported diseases?
   - How are diseases distributed by age group?
   - What is the overall disease burden across different Local Government Areas (LGAs)?
   - Which diseases are most common in the region, and how do they vary by LGA and year?

### SQL Queries Overview

Below is a breakdown of the SQL queries included in the repository and their relevance to healthcare access analysis:

1. **Creating the Database**  
   The first query creates a database specifically for storing healthcare access data in Plateau State. This ensures that all data analysis is contained within a dedicated environment.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE Plateau_State_Healthcare_Access;
   ```

2. **Selecting Top 10 Records**  
   This query retrieves the top 10 records from the dataset, providing a quick overview of the available data.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau;
   ```

3. **Gender-Based Disease Distribution**  
   This query identifies the gender with the most reported diseases by counting the number of disease instances per gender. Understanding gender differences in disease reporting can guide targeted health interventions.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT Gender, COUNT(ID) AS 'Total Diseases'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
   GROUP BY Gender;
   ```

4. **Age-Group Distribution of Diseases**  
   This query shows how diseases are distributed across different age groups. By analyzing age-based disease trends, policymakers can allocate resources more effectively to age groups most in need of healthcare services.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT Age_Group, COUNT(ID) AS 'Total Diseases'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
   GROUP BY Age_Group
   ORDER BY 'Total Diseases' DESC;
   ```

5. **Total Disease Count**  
   This query provides the total number of disease cases reported in the dataset. This serves as a baseline for understanding the overall healthcare burden in Plateau State.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Total Diseases'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau;
   ```

6. **Disease Count by LGA (Local Government Area)**  
   This query calculates the disease count across different LGAs in Plateau State. Identifying LGAs with high disease counts can help direct healthcare resources to areas with the greatest need.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT LGA, COUNT(*) AS 'Disease Count'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
   GROUP BY LGA
   ORDER BY 'Disease Count' DESC;
   ```

7. **Disease Count by Year**  
   This query tracks the total number of diseases reported per year. Analyzing the temporal distribution of diseases can reveal trends and patterns over time, which is crucial for tracking the effectiveness of healthcare interventions.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT Year AS 'Year', COUNT(*) AS 'Disease Count'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
   GROUP BY Year;
   ```

8. **Most Common Diseases**  
   This query lists the diseases most frequently reported in the dataset. Understanding which diseases are most prevalent allows health authorities to prioritize these conditions for public health campaigns.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT Disease, COUNT(*) AS 'Disease Count'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
   GROUP BY Disease
   ORDER BY 'Disease Count' DESC;
   ```

9. **Disease Distribution by LGA and Disease Type**  
   This query further refines the disease distribution by showing the frequency of each disease in different LGAs. It allows for a deeper understanding of which diseases are geographically concentrated in specific areas.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT LGA, Disease, COUNT(*) AS 'Frequency'
   FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
   GROUP BY LGA, Disease
   ORDER BY 'Frequency' DESC;
   ```

10. **Filtering by Specific LGA (Mikang)**  
    This query allows the user to filter and identify diseases reported in a specific LGA (in this case, Mikang). It helps to focus on a particular area for a more detailed analysis.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Disease, COUNT(*) AS 'Frequency'
    FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
    WHERE LGA = 'Mikang'
    GROUP BY Disease;
    ```

11. **Filtering by Specific Year (2022)**  
    This query filters the diseases reported in a specific year, such as 2022. Yearly analysis helps track the evolution of diseases over time and monitor the success of health interventions.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Disease, COUNT(*) AS 'Frequency'
    FROM healthcare_access_outcomes_plateau
    WHERE Year = 2022
    GROUP BY Disease;
    ```

### Connection to Healthcare Access Project

This repository is a key part of a broader project aimed at analyzing healthcare access in Plateau State. By querying disease data, we are able to extract meaningful insights that will assist local healthcare authorities in making informed decisions regarding healthcare service allocation, disease prevention efforts, and public health education campaigns.

Through this analysis, we can:
- **Identify gaps in healthcare access**: Determine which demographic groups (age, gender, location) are most affected by disease.
- **Direct healthcare resources more efficiently**: Pinpoint which areas (LGAs) have the highest disease burden and require additional healthcare services.
- **Track healthcare trends over time**: Monitor changes in disease patterns across years to evaluate the effectiveness of health interventions.

This project is an integral part of improving healthcare outcomes and access in Plateau State by providing data-driven insights for policymakers, health workers, and other stakeholders.
